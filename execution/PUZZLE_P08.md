# P-08 — Recover Without Ruining

**Execution prompt · snapshot 27 October 2026 / `ca01433` · Scientific puzzle.**



## Assignment

Implement this canonical puzzle as an interactive, deterministic component of the main campaign. Preserve the exact rules, hints, result criteria and safe retries below.

Execute this bounded task, integrate it with the current project and produce the acceptance evidence below. First reconcile the snapshot with current files; reuse already approved work and complete the real remaining gap.


## Mandatory shared context

Read [02_SHARED_CONTRACT.md](02_SHARED_CONTRACT.md), [03_SYSTEM_INTERFACES.md](03_SYSTEM_INTERFACES.md), [04_CURRENT_STATE.md](04_CURRENT_STATE.md), [05_ACCEPTANCE_AND_HANDOFF.md](05_ACCEPTANCE_AND_HANDOFF.md). Also read the current [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [PRODUCTION_HANDBOOK.md](../PRODUCTION_HANDBOOK.md) and newest [HANDOFF.md](../HANDOFF.md) entries. Current locked English-only, faceless plants, anime cast and scientific boundaries override older source wording.


## Inputs to inspect

- [game-design/08_PUZZLE_DESIGNS.md](../game-design/08_PUZZLE_DESIGNS.md)
- [docs/GAMEPLAY_DESIGN_FINAL.md](../docs/GAMEPLAY_DESIGN_FINAL.md)
- [full-game-story/story-data.json](../full-game-story/story-data.json)
- [game-design/10_GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS.md](../game-design/10_GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS.md)


## Ownership and dependencies

Own one puzzle model/controller and focused tests. Reuse SYS04 simulation for shared arithmetic, SYS05 transactions, SYS06 dialogue and the appropriate UI panel; do not fork them.

SYS02 content, SYS03 state, SYS04 simulation, SYS05 interactions, SYS07 checkpoints, appropriate room/prop/UI tasks and its owning expansion missions.


## Detailed work sequence

1. Translate source initial state, legal inputs, subchecks and completion predicate into typed data and explicit testable transitions.
2. Agree which shared state/profile fields the puzzle reads/writes; proposed root `game/scripts/puzzles/`. Keep presentation separate from the pure rule model.
3. Build observable equipment/diagram/UI feedback for correct, incorrect, partial and blocked actions, including the documented progressive hints.
4. Implement the real action sequence with keyboard/controller/tap alternatives and timer assistance; no motor precision penalty changes story access.
5. Use the same rule function in preview and commit; protect idempotent costs/evidence and current knowledge.
6. Create source witness/boundary tests, including reset/cancel/paused/reloaded/duplicate input cases. When the source gives numbers, assert exact results, not just non-null states.
7. Embed the puzzle at its actual expansion mission gates and verify the actor/location/time/pressure/inventory implications.
8. Document the versioned inputs, accepted result receipt and next consumer; report any source counterexample without quietly changing rules.


## Task-specific source and implementation detail

## P-08 — Recover Without Ruining

- **Mission / reason:** [M-0402](../game-design/07_MISSION_DESIGNS/M-0402_Twelve_in_the_Dark.md) — Recover a sealed vault and stabilise its dry specimens at home.
- **Location / equipment:** LOC-10; External probe, insulated sleeve, cradle, rover cargo mount, quarantine glove box.
- **Initial state:** Outer case cold; biological inner seal intact. Handling order unverified; inner seed temperature history recorded in insulated vault, not equal to lunar soil temperature.
- **Player instructions and intermediate steps:** Outside: read probe, fit sleeve, latch cradle, secure rover mount. At base: dock sealed case in dry glove box, run warm-up from cold→cool→room as three confirmed stages, verify no condensation, open inner seal, inventory twelve distinct specimen labels from the vault ledger in 18, scan lid.
- **Accepted solution:** Probe→sleeve→cradle→mount→return→dry glove box→three-stage sealed warm-up→condensation check→open→12 labels.
- **Incorrect actions and feedback:** Open command outside or before dry warm-up is blocked with condensation explanation. Wrong label can be corrected; a damaged-outer-case false alarm does not destroy specimens.
- **Progressive hints H1 / H2 / H3:** Keep it sealed until home. / Warm dry seeds in their closed container. / Complete sleeve/cradle, then three warm-up stages in the glove box before opening.
- **Difficulty, timing and retry:** Medium; no timer; checkpoint field-secured and home-docked.
- **Completion trigger:** Twelve distinct specimens recorded; lid scanned; quarantine status set pending viability evaluation, not assumed healthy.
- **Narrative consequence / flags:** vault_recovered_pending; vault_specimens 12; vault_cotton 1; vault_note_seen.
- **Accessible input:** Every drag or hold also has Select source → Select target → Confirm; every visual observation has a text-equivalent reading. No puzzle requires colour perception, audio frequency discrimination, fast repeated presses or pixel-perfect pointing. A hint does not penal is e the ending.

### Final-edition mapping

Use expansion chapter 4 and its four `EX-M` missions. Legacy SC/M identifiers inside the quoted source provide puzzle provenance only. Keep the full 96 scene/32 mission graph.


## Required deliverables

- Editable source and actual runtime deliverables in the established project layout.
- A bounded integration fixture or owning-scene hookup, with exact resource/API paths and stable IDs.
- Meaningful task-specific checks, actual execution results and visual/audio evidence where required.
- Updated affected manifests/provenance, and a precise handoff for the next dependent owner.


## Acceptance — demonstrate every applicable item

- Every source completion conjunct is tested and driven by actual validated actions.
- Shared numeric contracts, resource caps/order and dated biological/logistical effects remain unchanged.
- Wrong hypotheses produce explanatory feedback and a local supported retry.
- Assistance and captions preserve the same accepted result and ending eligibility.
- Pause, cancellation, duplicate input and save/reload preserve a coherent authoritative state where this task is interactive.
- English captions/text, named icons and assisted input preserve all essential information and story access.
- No unlogged generation, unsupported measured claim, new paid tool, secret, unrelated change or unrequested commit/push.


## Completion report

Use `05_ACCEPTANCE_AND_HANDOFF.md`. Record current HEAD, exact files, input revisions, commands and actual outcomes; identify current versus historical evidence. Mark unexecuted checks explicitly. Update production status only after the concrete deliverables pass the applicable gate. Do not count this prompt file itself as completed implementation.
