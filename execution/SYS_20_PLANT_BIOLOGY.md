# SYS20 — Plant identity, dated lifecycle, care and viability service

**Execution prompt · snapshot 27 October 2026 / `ca01433` · Shared runtime.**



## Assignment

Implement the shared biological state model that drives original plants, descendants, crops and cotton.

Execute this bounded task, integrate it with the current project and produce the acceptance evidence below. First reconcile the snapshot with current files; reuse already approved work and complete the real remaining gap.


## Mandatory shared context

Read [02_SHARED_CONTRACT.md](02_SHARED_CONTRACT.md), [03_SYSTEM_INTERFACES.md](03_SYSTEM_INTERFACES.md), [04_CURRENT_STATE.md](04_CURRENT_STATE.md), [05_ACCEPTANCE_AND_HANDOFF.md](05_ACCEPTANCE_AND_HANDOFF.md). Also read the current [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [PRODUCTION_HANDBOOK.md](../PRODUCTION_HANDBOOK.md) and newest [HANDOFF.md](../HANDOFF.md) entries. Current locked English-only, faceless plants, anime cast and scientific boundaries override older source wording.


## Inputs to inspect

- [game/project.godot](../game/project.godot)
- [game-design/08_PUZZLE_DESIGNS.md](../game-design/08_PUZZLE_DESIGNS.md)
- [production/review/codex_readiness_report.md](../production/review/codex_readiness_report.md)
- [full-game-story/story-data.json](../full-game-story/story-data.json)
- Existing `game/scripts/`, `game/tools/` and `production/tools/` modules relevant to this task; verify exact names before editing.


## Ownership and dependencies

Own the shared service named in this prompt, its proposed resource/API contract and targeted tests. Preserve existing player/rendering APIs. Publish the interface handshake before UI, asset or mission owners implement callers.

Follow the Phase 0 order in `06_EXECUTION_BOARD.md`. Treat new module names in `03_SYSTEM_INTERFACES.md` as proposals until agreed; do not claim an unimplemented dependency already exists.


## Detailed work sequence

1. Import the final planting/bloom/pollination/maturity/dry-down/harvest dates and separate individual/parent/lineage identifiers.
2. Represent original Alo/Tara, compatible reciprocal pollen transfers, seven care days and three runs; pollen is never a physical seed.
3. Drive seed/sprout/bud/bloom/pollinated/pod/dry/stress visual states from dated approved events, never elapsed wall-clock absence.
4. Conserve founder 42/planting 12/reserve 30 and separate later-generation harvests; never consume the 30 reserve to invent October descendants.
5. Preserve vault 12 and cotton planted 15 December/stored 11; distinguish specimen inspection from proven viability and later germination.
6. Connect crop condition/yield and care/pressure/light/water effects to the shared simulation, with correct source qualifiers and text feedback.
7. Test natural original Alo end, repeated care receipts, time jumps, pause/save/load and invalid premature harvest.


## Task-specific source and implementation detail

### Baseline integration checkpoints

- Source content: 8 chapters/32 missions/96 scenes/385 lines.
- Existing game foundation: 49 GLBs, current five 44 clip characters, sixdev/player/look scenes, three anime OGVs.
- Main campaign and Chapter 1 rooms/UI are not automatically completed by the presence of those assets.
- Historical technical-blueprint 16 mission/48 scene structure is superseded; reuse its transaction ideas under the final IDs.
- Existing tests live under `game/tools/`; execute the affected suites with the installed Godot and `--headless --path game --script res://tools/<actual_test>.gd`. Inspect test fixture portability first; record a missing Mac scratch fixture rather than inventing a passing run.


## Required deliverables

- Editable source and actual runtime deliverables in the established project layout.
- A bounded integration fixture or owning-scene hookup, with exact resource/API paths and stable IDs.
- Meaningful task-specific checks, actual execution results and visual/audio evidence where required.
- Updated affected manifests/provenance, and a precise handoff for the next dependent owner.


## Acceptance — demonstrate every applicable item

- Every visible plant stage resolves to the correct individual/date/lineage.
- No face, vacuum exposure, instant seed maturity, radiation immunity or immortal original.
- Model swaps and captions express the same authoritative biological state.
- Pause, cancellation, duplicate input and save/reload preserve a coherent authoritative state where this task is interactive.
- English captions/text, named icons and assisted input preserve all essential information and story access.
- No unlogged generation, unsupported measured claim, new paid tool, secret, unrelated change or unrequested commit/push.


## Completion report

Use `05_ACCEPTANCE_AND_HANDOFF.md`. Record current HEAD, exact files, input revisions, commands and actual outcomes; identify current versus historical evidence. Mark unexecuted checks explicitly. Update production status only after the concrete deliverables pass the applicable gate. Do not count this prompt file itself as completed implementation.
